# MbsEditor
View and edit .mbs data files from stencyl games.
***
Building on the code in [mbs-io](https://github.com/Monkeytron/mbs-io) this program has a simple interface for viewing and editing data from mbs files.

##Current features

- Can open the scene data files (eg scene-10.mbs) and view the data within them.
- The positions of all level terrain collision and any actors in the scene are displayed.
- All values in the file can be edited easily through this interface.
- Once editing is complete, you can save your changes to a new mbs file and run it in the game!

##Installation

To install: download the code, go to bin/publish and double click on setup.exe.
Once installed the program should auto update every time you open it... If I programmed it right.

##Possible improvements

- The tile map of the level (what the background and floor looks like etc) is not stored in an mbs file. Instead, it is kept in a .scn file: currently I cannot open those files, instead use [hpr's program scnedit](https://hpr.github.io/scnedit) to view these.
- I'm not sure how intuitive the program is if you don't know mbs files, so I might make a set of video tutorials.
- This version is very simple - it has little error checking and will probably crash occasionally. I will fix this soon.
