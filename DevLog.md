### V 1.5.0.0
- Added behavior.mbs reading functionality: by opening a scene file as normal and then opening a behavior file using the same button, it loads the names of all behaviors and attributes to make everything easier.
- That's it for now I guess unless I broke something :)

### V 1.4.2.0

- Minor visual improvements
- Fixed bug where new objects added to lists were not visible in the main view
- Fixed bug where attempting to create new attributes for behaviors would throw an error
- Fixed other various bugs with lists and attributes
- Added button to automatically order actors by their z position and layer order, automatically assinging those as required
- Added button to refresh everything on the screen (should fix any weird bugs with lists not displaying properly)
